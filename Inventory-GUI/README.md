Inventory-GUI
=============

Inventory GUI using PocketMine plugins!

Use the command /opts (aliases: /invgui, /ig) to open the GUI menu: The inventory is (visibly to the player) set to the desired items, and then (probably) the inventory menu pops up. When the player selects the item, the GUI function is called.

A GUI can also be the parent of other GUIs, in which when the GUI is tapped, the inventory changes into another GUI list, just like an options screen in a television. Wondrous?
