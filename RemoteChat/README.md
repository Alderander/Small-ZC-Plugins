RemoteChat
===
This plugin allows players from different servers to chat. It sends messages in a request-based form. It provides protection by adding blacklists/whitelists,

This plugin will have a function API and may eventually become a protocol for "emails" between different servers. The listener server is run on a separate thread, and requests are sent from `AsyncTask`s.
