SpicyCapacitorr
===
A plugin that works like a capacitor to shift out spicy reports from players smoothly to operators.

## Why is it called SpicyCapacitor?
A capacitor in an electric circuit collects uneven electric charge and releases the charge smoothly to stabilize the signal. SpicyCapacitor collects reports about misbehavior of players and, adding extra information like chat logs, motion logs, etc., to the report and stores them into a queue of reports so that when operators want to view reports, they can easily view the oldest report and manage it. This plugin also provides a ban point system so that players can receive proper penalties by judging how bad he had behaved.

As for why spicy?
* Long and wrong answer: Reports and bans are dangerous, makes some people feel uncomfortable and some excited. Just like spicy pepper.
* Short and true answer: https://github.com/new gave me that idea.
