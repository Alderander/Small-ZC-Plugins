Simple introduction: WorldEditArt helps you to change a large amount of blocks at a same time via various methods.
Simple command list: No, just run `//help <page>` in game and look at the commands you have.
Simple feature list: selection of different shapes, setting and replacing blocks within a selection, jump like TPCompass
Unstable feature list: macros, clipboards, wands

FAQ

- [I]****, there are no any commands when I check my commands on console! Shouldn't console have permission to all commands?[/I]
- [I]Why are there only a few commands when I used [U]//[/U]?[/I]
Please read the wiki. The help page only shows the commands you can currently use.
When you are on console, there are no commands that you could use since you are not in-game. Please join the game to use the commands.
When you are in-game, if you hadn't made a selection, you don't have access to commands like //set since these commands
