Gudielines for Creating Issues
===

* Confirm that issues are not to be duplicated before creating one.
* Do not make custom tags except [RepoName]. For other tags, I will add them via [labels](https://github.com/PEMapModder/Small-ZC-Plugins/labels) myself
* Do not make generic titles like "Help", "Question", etc.
* Paste crash dumps in pastebins like http://pastebin.com
* Try to confirm that the issue is related to this plugin.
* If possible, find out the crash dump on http://crash.pocketmine.net
* Only use the issues to report bugs or request features. Support requests should be done on the PocketMine forums plugin release thread or contacting me via PM on PocketMine forums, or finding me (@PEMapModder) on Twitter or asking on freenode IRC channel `#pmplugins`.
* Please provide a professional report for bugs. By "professional", I mean:
  * The bug should be **reproducible**.
  * The title should be as brief (short and clean but specific) as possible. Details should be provided in the issue body.
* For feature requests,
  * The feature must not be duplicated.
  * Confirm, if possible, that the feature is possible.
* Do not use the issue conversation as a forum.
* If you offend these rules, your issue may be edited, closed, locked, or even your account may be blocked from interacting with the repositories of @PEMapModder.
* For pull requests,
  * Please test your changes, or specify that it is untested if you don't want to or cannot
  * Please conform to the [PocketMine contribution guidelines code style](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
